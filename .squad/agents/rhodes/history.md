## Project Context

**Project:** VivaLaResistance
**Role:** Lead
**User:** ThindalTV
**Stack:** C# .NET MAUI, iOS + Android only, SLNX solution format, ML/Vision for resistor detection
**Mission:** Camera app that detects resistors, calculates values from color bands, displays AR-style overlays next to each resistor. Multiple resistors per frame. 7-day free trial then dismissible support modal (WinRAR-style).
