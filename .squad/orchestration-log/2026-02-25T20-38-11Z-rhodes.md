## Mission
Created CI pipeline workflow for issue #1, opened PR #35 on branch squad/1-ci-pipeline.

## Artifacts Produced
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Three-job GitHub Actions workflow (test, build-android, build-ios)
- `README.md` — Updated with CI badge
- Branch: `squad/1-ci-pipeline`
- PR: #35

## Decision Context
- Three separate jobs instead of matrix for OS-specific runners (ubuntu for test/Android, macos for iOS)
- iOS build uses `/p:BuildIpa=false` (no signing required in CI)
- Test job skips MAUI workload (tests are net9.0 only)
- NuGet cache keyed per OS to prevent cross-contamination
- CI workflow isolated from existing squad infrastructure workflows

## Status
✅ Complete. Awaiting review (Natasha assigned).
