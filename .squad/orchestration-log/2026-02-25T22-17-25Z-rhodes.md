# Orchestration Log — Rhodes

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T22:17:25Z  
**Agent:** Rhodes (Lead)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Rhodes reviewed the vision library comparison document and approved a two-phase technical approach for resistor detection:

1. **Phase 1:** SkiaSharp + custom HSV color analysis (classical CV, no ML model)
2. **Phase 2:** ONNX Runtime + lightweight detection model (YOLOv8-nano) for robust localization

Decision document written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/rhodes-vision-library-decision.md` and appended to Rhodes' history.md.

## Outputs

- Decision approval recorded and rationalized
- Architectural guidance provided to Bruce and Shuri on camera frame format, TFM targets, UX mitigations, and model acquisition strategy
- Rhodes history.md updated with vision library decision and key learnings

## Next Steps

- Bruce and Shuri implement Phase 1 per decision conditions and action items
- Camera frame format contract to be formalized (recommend BGRA8888)
- Services project TFM validation before Phase 2 commitment
